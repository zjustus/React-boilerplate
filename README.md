# A better React boilerplate
unline npx create-react-app this template uses up to date libraries and does not hide the compiled code.

The website generated could easily be coppied to a static website hosting provider like S3 or ran as a standalone.  
For development this repo has a docker-compose file and spools up a express webserver on port 8080.  
Have fun.
